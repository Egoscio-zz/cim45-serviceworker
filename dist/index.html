            <h3>What are the main characteristics of a PWA?</h3>
            <p>
                Progressive Web Applications, also known as "PWA's", are web
                applications that are reliable, fast, and engaging.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Reliable</b> because they don't require a persistent
                    internet connection to access preloaded content, thanks to
                    service workers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Fast</b> since they load inestentaneously, and are
                    responsive to user input.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Engaging</b> because they are launched just like any
                    other application on a user's device, can send push
                    notifications, and can dictate advanced layout configuration
                    such as device orientation.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Caching, push notifications, are local data storage fundemental
                technologies used to make PWA's.
            </p>
            <p>
                A very fundemental aspect of PWA's is the "manifest file", which
                dictates information about the application such as available app
                icons, orientation, application name, and the application's
                starting page.
